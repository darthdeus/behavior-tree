**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This crate is under heavy development at the moment and a lot of the APIs will change often and without any notice. Performance is also terrible right now.**

## Other behavior tree crates

There are a few other crates that implement behavior trees (listed below).
This library is inspired by all of them, as well as the [Behavior Tree Starter
Kit from Game AI
Pro](https://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro/GameAIPro_Chapter06_The_Behavior_Tree_Starter_Kit.pdf).
